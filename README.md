# About Me

3rd generation nerd, RadioShack kid, freelance administrator of the 2000s.
I operated a variety of game, voice, IRC, database, and web servers.
My first computer was a hand-me-down IBM ThinkPad with Windows 3.11.
Outside the browser, my first programming language was VisualBasic6 r.i.p.

I have been working outside of the computer industry since 2015.
Currently having tons of fun with Zig, which has inspired me to take
programming seriously again.
